        Ellen Bass's research develops theories of human performance,
        quantitative modeling methodologies, and associated experimental designs
        that can be used to evaluate human-automation interaction in the context
        of total system performance. The outcomes of the research can be used in
        the systems engineering process: to inform system requirements,
        procedures, display designs and training interventions and to support
        system evaluation. The long term goal is to develop comprehensive
        measures, modeling techniques and evaluation methods that capture the
        contribution of human operators (knowledge, skills, and limitations),
        the dynamic task environment, the tools used (algorithms, decision
        support tools, displays), organizational factors (such as team roles)
        and all of their interactions. Her research contributions can be
        decomposed into four synergistic areas:{" "}
